80% of the code and paddle and ball behaviours were copied from youtube. Game conditions, notes and timer and such were added by yours truly (:'D)
You might have to install the "turtle" module. Open up a terminal in your IDE and write "pip install turtle"

# Known issues:
  i) Can't take two keyboard inputs at one time
  ii) The paddle blocks area are a bit glitchy
  iii) The speed cannot be increased without some weird glitch which causes the game to be unplayable
  iv) I have no idea how to fix these.
